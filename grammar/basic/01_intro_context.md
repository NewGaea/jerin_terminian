# Introduction to Jerin's Terminian
---

## Foreword

Welcome to Jerin's documentation of the Classical Terminian language. There are a number of people out there producing various Hylian dictionaries, and each is created by a different person with a different view. This resource is no different, though it seeks to produce a language which could be used to produce, at the minimum, a full translation of _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask._

This language is based on the prior work of the author _Kasuto of Kataan,_ who produced an Esperanto-like Hylian language which was intended to be spoken in the era of _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time._ This language is preserved and documented with Kasuto's permission, and updated by Jerin, in a separate GitHub repository. Kasuto's dictionary carried the feeling of an Indo-European language which evolved parallel to our own IE languages, with a lot of areal influence from Japanese cultures. The strict regularity of this language feel engineered, and Jerin actually interprets it as a language engineered by the King of Hyrule based upon the already spoken languages of the time.

**Classical Terminian** is designed to be more akin to the naturalistic sister of what we are calling **Classical Hylian** -- it has greater irregularity, while often sharing the stems of Kasuto's project. The shared stems make the two languages mutually intelligible, even if they are not perfectly interfluent. Much like the updated documentation of **Classical Hylian,** this language is produced without input from Kasuto. This is Jerin's project, open to invited collaborators.

## Why We Create Terminian

We all know that we cannot actually visit **Termina** outside of the releases of _Majora's Mask,_ the manga, and fan interpretations thereof. It is, nonetheless, fun to imagine the language, lands, and broader world of Termina. It is to this end that Jerin is studying and reconstructing this niche language within the _Mudoran_ language family.

> **Mudoran** languages are all of the languages spoken by Hylians and their neighbors until Ganondorf's invasion of the Sacred Realm as depicted in _Ocarina of Time_. While the language of later games are still descended from this family, they are divided into three familes: _Neo-Mudoran_ languages are largely spoken in the lands outside of Hyrule and its immediate neighbors, _Neo-Hylian_ languages are largely spoken within Hyrule and its immediate, nearest neighbors (such Calatia), and _Poganian_ languages are largely spoken in the overseas former-colonies of Hyrule.

It is obvious that Hylians and their neighbors, near or far, wouldn't actually speak Japanese or English, nor indeed any other language from our Earth -- they live on an alternate, post-apocalyptic world which may, or may not, be based on our own. Many fan-made dictionaries fail to be useful for more than the occasional word or phrase, usually to suit the interests of a specific fan author. It is our objective (as stated above) to make a rich enough language that we can translate the script of _Majora's Mask_ into Terminian, and any other languages we make will share similar goals for whatever game, or games, best fit them.

So we have three smaller objectives on the road to this major objective: We must establish the **sounds** of the language which serve to distinguish it from Hylian, we must establish the **words** of the language which express ideas, and we must establish the **grammar rules** of the language that allow ideas to be clearly communicated. For the time being, we are borrowing the written form of Terminian from our updates to Kasuto's Hylian, though we may establish a new script at a later time.

### Phonology

This is not the place to explain everything, but in short, the phonology of **Terminian** will be different from **Classical Hylian**, with some sounds being removed or altered. However, the phonology of **Classical Hylian** is a reference, so that the two languages can be reasonably intelligible between each other. This may mean some linguistically rare sounds are eliminated for more common sounds, or that qualities not important in **Classical Hylian** are meaningful in **Terminian.**

### Grammar

**Terminian** is meant to be a more naturalistic language than **Classical Hylian,** and so will definitely do away with the strict grammatical marking rules of Kasuto's language. At this time, other features have not been decided. It is our intention to include the following primary grammatical classes:

+ Nouns, Pronouns
+ Verbs
+ Adjectives, Adverbs
+ Postpositions (not prepositions!)
+ Clitics

### Lexicon

A set of rules alone does not make a language, nor does a set of words alone. But when both are brought together, we get a language. The words of Terminian will be rich and reflect the observations of the culture of Termina as seen in _Majora's Mask_ -- which means not every word will cleanly translate to a single English word!

## Writing Terminian

At this point in time, Terminian may be written using Hylian fonts created by Kasuto or compatible with his fonts, or in romanized form using standard Latin script. We may develop our own alternative script at a later time, to help reflect the phonological difference between Hylian and Terminian. If we do this, we will not be taking any special concerns to make sure the language looks like, or unlike, any other script, only that it looks consistent within itself.

# Context of Classical Terminian

The Hylian Linguistic Society exists in the aftermath of _Tears of the Kingdom_, and is researching as much linguistic history as possible. We are not necessarily trying to revive these languages, only to document and preserve them for the benefit of future scholars.

Within Termina, the Terminian people have five languages: Classical Terminian serves as a trade and diplomatic language, one which most people are able to speak or at least understand. This is the language primarily explored in this documentation. The languages of Terminian Gorons, Zoras, Deku Scrubs, and the ancient Ikana are local tongues spoken primarily within their own communities, and less well documented than Terminian.

Termina is a land somewhere to the northeast of Classical Hyrule. Trade between the two lands is rare, but not unheard of, and the land is considered too distant to have been part of the Unification War between the warlords of Central Hyrule. This is why the Terminians still speak their own Hylian Tribal language.

There is a degree of class stratification in Terminian, largely marked by word choice and adherence to formal grammatical structures. Unless otherwise noted, all grammar taught in this guide is that of the general citizenry, and a more polite or proper word choice will be preferred in polite circumstances.

### History of the Terminian Language

> _**Note:** The following text is an in-setting history, and does not reflect upon any strict canonical contents of the video games._

**Terminian** is, to the best of our records, a terminal branch of the **Mudoran** languages, which is to say that we are unfamiliar with any descendants of the language. As a **Mudoran** language, it is a descendant of **Proto-Mudoran,** the earliest known language in our world. It is further derived from **Proto-Hylian,** the parent of the largest branch of **Mudoran** languages, the **Hylian** family. The earliest writings which have been found to date are from early members of the **Hylian** language family.

While the origins of **Mudoran** itself are little understood, **Proto-Hylian** arose among a variety of semi-settled hunter-gatherer tribes in the ancient _Mudoran Steppe_, and was used to trade goods for goods, and to arrange marriages between tribes (though it seems it was common for the young men of each tribe to move into neighboring tribes, and for the remaining maidens to accept mates who came in from other neighboring tribes). The earliest stories of the Three Goddesses and the Goddess-Queen seem to trace back to the time of **Mudoran,** but they seem to have become clearer in the age of **Proto-Hylian.**

+ **Mudoran** is the last common ancestor to all known languages spoken in the lands of Hyrule throughout recorded history. It is, notably, the source of common vocabulary between the Zonai and Hylians, as well as Hylians and Zora, Rito, Gorons, and even The God Tribe. The term is so culturally established that it is often used colloquially to refer to any old version of the language!
+ **Proto-Hylian** had strong grammatical forms which allowed for non-configurational speech, but it had no written form. Proto-Hylian was the common ground of the religious traditions of the ancient Hylian people, and the language they shared with the Tribe of the Sky Gods, or Zonai (though the Zonai had their own language, which did have a written form in this age!). The first Kingdom of Hyrule was founded at the end of this age, giving way to...
+ **Ancient Hylian,** which arose when the tribes began to coalesce into distinct cultures. Wielding the power of _Secret Stones,_ **King Rauru** of the Zonai and **Queen Sonia** of the Hyliand created a confederation of the tribal cultures of the **Hyliands**, **Eastern Gerudo**, **Gorons**, **Zora**, and **Rito**, with alliances with the **Kikiko** and **Mogma.** King Rauru and Queen Sonia had a daughter, **Ylia,** before they passed away in a war with the *Demon King, Ganondorf* of the **Western Gerudo.** During this time, early ideographic and hieroglyphic writing was developed, but this language became the unifying tie between all of the tribes and peoples from the **Akwol Ocean** to the **Lanaru Sea**, from **Hebra Mountain** to the **Gerudo Peninsula**.
+ In the time during the reign of **Princess Ylia**, the Sheikah tribe was established as her personal bodyguard, and spoke a coded language called **Ancient Sheikah,** and the Western Gerudo and Eastern Gerudo dialects of Ancient Hylian were brought together as **Ancient Gerudo**.
