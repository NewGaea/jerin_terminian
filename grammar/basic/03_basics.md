# The Basics of Terminian Sentences
---

This grammar focuses on bring you up to speed on using **Terminian** as quickly as possible. However, Terminian is a grammatically complex language, with three primary bits of complexity to the average English speaker.

## Noun Classes

Terminian features 5 noun classes. While these classes are widely referred to as Class 1 - 5, they are also formally referred to as the Neutral, Masculine, Feminine, Noble, and Divine, in order. Each class indicates a higher degree of animacy or agency, and is indicated by several possible endings, and the standard rules of sentence construction require higher animacy nouns to come before lower animacy, regardless of the relationship between them.

## Articles

There are three basic articles in Terminian: The Absolute article, the Definite Article, and the Indefinite article. Each of these articles inflects for class and number, as follows:

|            | Stem | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3 | Class 4 | Class 5 |
|:----------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Indefinite | r-   | re      | reu     | raa     | rila    | rose    |
| Definite   | t-   | te      | teu     | taa     | tila    | tose    |
| Absolute   | f-   | fe      | feu     | faa     | fila    | fose    |

All of these articles pattern as and agree with nouns, and so can also be inflected as plural forms by adding an \<**-n**> suffix.

### Indefinite Article

The indefinite article is used to refer to a general, generic, or non-specific instance of something. It is similar to how English uses the articles *a* and *an* in that it does not specify exactly what referent it refers to, but to one, or some, of a group.

### Definite Article

The definite article is used to refer to a particular or specific instance of something which has been established within discourse. Is is used in a similar manner to English *the* in that it refers to an individual or group which has been specified.

### Absolute Article

The absolute article is an interesting case, as it is like a strong form of the definite article. The absolute article is used when referring to something definite which may not have been established in discourse, but which one expects their interlocutor to already know, relying on a deeper or broader context to cite something.

Absolute articles may be used when referring to the biomes of Termina, unique features such as the Clocktower of Clock Town, or to individuals who would generally be unique and: "*faa Lulu*" could be interpreted as something akin to, "the one and only Lulu" while "*fe maetju*" refers to "the Swamp(s of Termina)."
