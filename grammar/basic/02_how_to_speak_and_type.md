# How to Speak and Type Terminian
---
**Classical Terminian** is a simpler language, phonologically, than **Classical Hylian,** having more separation in how sounds are produced.

The phonology of Modern Hylian is very similar to that of late 20th century English.

### Consonants

The consonants of Terminian are similar to English, except that they distinguish between unaspirated, aspirated, and voiced stops. The best way to summarize this difference to an English speaker unfamiliar with aspiration is to say the words _pit_ and _spit_, and listen to the difference between the two different \<p\> sounds. Usually, English speakers will have an unaspirated \<p\> in _spit_ with an aspirated \<p<sup>h</sup>\> in _pit_.

Because of this three-way distinction, you should take care when speaking Terminian, especially if you are not well practiced in the use and identification of aspirated consonants. When typing **Terminian,** the superscript \<<sup>h</sup>\> notation is recommended, but there is no conflict between any of the stops as \<ph\> versus \<p<sup>h</sup>\>. You may also use what we call apostrophe notation, or \<p’\> style indication of aspiration. This style is permitted, but not preferred as it can conflict with contractions and affix notation.

| **open** |  |  |  | a |  |  |

**Terminian** has less rigid pronunciation rules than **Classical Hylian,** and most vowels are pronounced by a stress rule that tends to stress the first syllable if it contains a high vowel, or the second syllable otherwise. However, unusual stress is marked by either doubling the vowel (indicating stress with the unstressed or natural form) or writing \<e\> or \<h\> after the vowel (indicating stress with the stressed form).

The vowels may also be either palatalized, indicated with a _diaeresis_ \<äëïöü\>, or labialized, indicated with a _circumflex_ \<âêîôû\>.
