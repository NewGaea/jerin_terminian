# A Basic Overview of the Hylian Language
---

Before we address the grammar in more technical bits, it's understandable that you readers will want an overview of the language to satisfy the mildly curious and to intrigue the more curious among you.

Classical Hylian is similar to Esperanto in how it marks words though it is simpler than Esperanto. The language contains articles, marks all words in Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun, or Vocative forms.

In addition to this, each word is marked for other aspects: Nouns, Pronouns, and Adjectives are marked for number (singular or plural), while Verbs are marked for Tense and certain other aspects or moods.

The Vocative is a special form used for generating names, often using either simple or compound words, frequently (but not always) adding a gender form, followed by the vocative suffix.

Most words in Hylian are formed by inflecting word _stems_, a fundamental part that can serve as the basis for any other type of word, and which often sits unmodified in compound words.

## Nouns

Nouns in Hylian are denoted by the ending \<_e_\> in the singular and \<_èn_\> in the plural. They represent persons, places, and things both concrete and abstract. Simple nouns always follow the same inflection pattern described above.

### Number

#### Singular Nouns

By default, nouns are treated as singular. All words which end with \<e\> are singular nouns, such as _lèrde_ (book) or _brinste_ (arm).

#### Plural Nouns

Plural nouns are marked by the \<èn\> suffix. All words which end in this suffix are plural nouns, such as _lèrdèn_ (books) or _brinstèn_ (arms).

| Stem | Singular | Plural |
|:-----|:---------|:----------------|
| **lèrd** | _lèrde_ (book) | _lèrdèn_ (books) |
| **brinst** | _brinste_ (arm) | _brinstèn_ (arms) |

### Gender

Unlike many Indo-European languages, Classical Hylian has no concept of grammatical gender, though it does allow for words to be composed with _semantic_ gender, or the expression of sex or gender of a given noun.

Any noun can be given a gender, and gendered terms like _piàntile_ (father) and _piàntine_ (mother) already use this method: They both share the stem _piant_ (parent), followed by a gender suffix -- \<_-il_\> for the masculine and \<_-in_\> for the feminine -- followed by the normal noun suffix \<_e_\>.

This means that any word hat ends in \<_ile_\> is a masculine singular, \<_ilèn_\> is a masculine plural as in _máshtinèn_ (kings), \<_ine_\> is a feminine singular, and \<_inèn_\> is a feminine plural, as in _déginèn_ (goddesses).

The stress on semantically gendered words remains where it would be in the neutral gender, and so must be indicated by an _asènta_ form of the proper vowel.

**NOTE:** Only **nouns** and **vocatives** ever take these suffixes, and do so at the end of their stem, before any other suffixes are added. Adjectives describing such words only need to agree with the number of the word.

| Stem | Neuter | Masculine | Feminine |
|:-----|:-------|:----------|:---------|
| **deg**  | _dege_   | _dégile_    | _dégine_   |
| **god**  | god    | god       | goddess  |

## Verbs

All verbs in Hylian follow a single, regular conjugation paradigm. For simplicity, a verb is **conjugated** when it conveys information about who or what is acting, when the action is performed, or other extra information about the verb. Hylian verbs primarily conjugate **only** for tense (when the verb happens), perfect (whethr the verb is complete), and three other forms: the infinitive (to be, to fly, etc.), the imperative mood (commands, rules, etc.), and the gerund being, flying, etc.) -- and every one of these conjugations is totally regular.

_**NOTE:** It's very important to note that the gerund is not well documented in contemporary sources, but is used regularly._

| Stem | Infinitive | Imperative | Gerund |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:-------|
| **tair** | _tairag_     | _tairans_    | _tairase_ |
| **koem** | _koemag_     | _koemans_    | _koemase_ |
| **goear** | _goearag_   | _goearans_   | _goearase_ |
| **lint** | _lintag_     | _lintans_    | _lintase_ |
| **zhat** | _zhatag_     | _zhatans_    | _zhatase_ |

### Verb Tenses

In English, verbs may change to indicate the subject, the number of subjects, and the tense, but in Classical Hylian, only the tense is important. The simplest tense to understand is the present: Things that are happening _now_ or in close time to now. The present tense is formed by adding \<-as\> to a stem, so _tair_ would become _tairas._

```gloss
\ex Bagu tairas.
\gla bagu tair.as
\glb 1S.PRON be.PRES
\glc I am
```
As noted above, Hylian does not conjugate for person or number, so _tairas_ would be used for all referents.

The next tense, which is used very commonly, is the past tense. This refers to events which have already happened. This tense is formed by adding \<_-es_\> to a stem

```gloss
\ex Soniainai-máshtine koemes.
\gla Sonia-in-ai-máshtine koem.es
\glb Sonia-FEM-VOC-ruler-FEM-N food.PAST
\glc Sonia-queen ate.
\ft Queen Sonia ate.
```
Finally, the last basic tense is the future tense, which is used for actions which have not yet happened, but will or are intended to. The future tense is formed by adding \<_-os_\> to the end of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Bagu zhatos ak sèru.
\gla Bag.u zhat.os ak sèr.u
\glb 1S.PRON speak.FUT towards 3SF.PRON
\glc I speak.will to her
\ft I will speak to her
```
### Perfect Verbs

Classical Hylian also contains a perfect tense for all three of its time tenses. The perfect tense simply refers to an action which is completed, though the nuances of this vary based on what time the verb occurs in.

The past perfect is used to refer to past events sequentially. A word in the past perfet tense happened **entirely before** another event in the past. That is to say, the perfect tense refers to an action or event that happened and was completed before another. This tense is formed by add \<_ènt_\> to the end of of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Bagu yaz koemènt az koeme depoto sèru yovtes.
\gla bag.u yaz koem.ènt az koem.e depot.o sèr.u yovt.es
\glb 1S.PRON already food.PASTPERF DIROBJ.DEF food.NOUN before.PREP 3SF.PRON arrive.PAST
\glc I already eaten-had the food before she arrived
\ft I had already eaten the food before she arrived.
```
Next is the present perfect, which refers to an event completed in the past but usually directly relevant to the present.
